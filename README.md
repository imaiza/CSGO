# CSGO

CS:GO is a game I love to play with my friends. I developed a project using a Kaggle dataset(https://www.kaggle.com/christianlillelund/csgo-round-winner-classification) to predict round winner in "inferno" map using supervised leearning algorithms. This project is also focused on studing differents feature subset selection techniques (univariate, multivariate, wrapper).

I also add a report of the work containing a deep analysis and conclusions about the work.
